When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  I can think of two main reasons for having a remote repository. The first one
  is, that you have a backup of your work, so in case of some kind of damage to
  the local data, the data will always be somewhere else too.
  The second reason is, if you want to collaborate with others, it's a
  convenient way to share and transmit changes to one another, whilst keeping
  it possible to work at the same time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Maybe if you are in the middle of working on something you don't want new
  Code and stuff coming in all the time. It just leaves you the freedom to
  decide by yourself when you want to update your local repository.
