When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  I can think of two main reasons for having a remote repository. The first one
  is, that you have a backup of your work, so in case of some kind of damage to
  the local data, the data will always be somewhere else too.
  The second reason is, if you want to collaborate with others, it's a
  convenient way to share and transmit changes to one another, whilst keeping
  it possible to work at the same time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Maybe if you are in the middle of working on something you don't want new
  Code and stuff coming in all the time. It just leaves you the freedom to
  decide by yourself when you want to update your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use on instead of another?

  Branches are like different paths in one repository. For example you could
  checkout a branch at one commit and then work on your new branch while not
  changing any of the code in the old branch and later merge them together.

  A clone is a complete copy of a repository, also including possible branches.

  A fork is a special type of clone on GitHub, which keeps track of who's
  repository it originally was and creates a link from the forked version
  back to the original.
