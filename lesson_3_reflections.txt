When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  I can think of two main reasons for having a remote repository. The
  first one is, that you have a backup of your work, so in case of some
  kind of damage to the local data, the data will always be somewhere else
  too.
  The second reason is, if you want to colaborate with others, it's a
  conveniant way to share and transmit changes to one another, whilst
  keeping it possible to work at the same time.
