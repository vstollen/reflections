What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize the repository git will create a ".git" folder for you,
  in which it stores the files needed for git to work. After initializing the
  repository it's possible to use the rest of git's functionality in that
  folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is like a virtual container or folder, in which you can put
  all the files you are planning to commit next time. You can't directly access
  files in you stating area. You have to modify them in you working directory
  and then add them to the staging area. It's like the link between working
  directory and repository.

  It could become handy if you forget to commit between two logical steps. With
  the stating area you could still make separate commits from the changes you
  made to different files.
